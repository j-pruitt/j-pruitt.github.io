				<p>As a driven and innovative tech professional, I bring a wealth of experience from my time as a Solutions Engineer at Zoho Corporation. With a strong background in software development and a passion for leveraging technology to drive business success, I have been instrumental in delivering world-class solutions to clients across various industries.</p>
				<p>During my tenure at Zoho, I served as a Zoho Expert, adeptly navigating the intricacies of Zoho Creator, Zoho Analytics, Zoho Flow, and Zoho One to build low-code applications and integrated solutions for clients. My work extended beyond pre-sales support, where I assisted Account Managers with technical demos and provided exceptional customer support during the onboarding period.</p>
				<p>I take immense pride in my ability to foster lasting relationships with clients, ensuring an impressive 80% customer retention rate. My focus on post-sales support involved seamless implementation, integration, and round-the-clock assistance, showcasing my commitment to customer success.</p>
				<p>Utilizing my full-stack web development expertise and proficiency in languages such as JavaScript, Python, SQL, and more, I collaborated with software development and testing teams to design robust solutions that met clients' unique requirements for functionality, scalability, and performance.</p>
				<p>Beyond my technical acumen, I actively contributed to user education initiatives, hosting engaging presentations and workshops across North America. The recent <a href="https://www.zoho.com/creator/roadshow-north-america/">2023 Zoho Creator Workshop Roadshow in Dallas, TX, Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX</a>, allowed me to share my knowledge and inspire others in the tech community.</p>
				<p>As a versatile and adaptable professional, I thrived in a hybrid work environment, demonstrating excellent communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. My experience with integration tools like Zapier, Zoho Flow, and API connections further showcased my ability to deliver seamless and efficient solutions.</p>
				<p>Now, I'm eagerly seeking new opportunities in the tech industry, where I can continue to make a meaningful impact and apply my expertise to drive innovation and success for forward-thinking organizations.</p>

I seriously wish every support experince in the world would be like James. He not only dealt with my frustration and lack of knowledge in a supportive and patient way, but he also walked me through my issue, fixed my code, and helped educate me in a way that felt mentoring and not like he was wanting me to go away. I VERY RARELY take the time to write a testimonial, but James absolutely deserves this one. If only people like James knew how much of a difference people like him make in the business world, and the world in general. It's people like him who make my company feel they made the right choice by choosing Zoho. He deserves a very special thanks. </p>
